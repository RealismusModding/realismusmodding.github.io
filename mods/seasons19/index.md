{% lead %}Seasons is about more than just adding pretty textures corresponding to a season and snow. It is an attempt to better simulate a year in a farmerâ€™s life. Nearly every aspect of Farming Simulator has been carefully rethought and rewritten from growth to weather, crop prices, loans and the vehicle maintenance system. It is a mod designed for the players who do not like being able to sow, harvest and sow again all in one day.{% endlead %}

For Farming Simulator 19, Seasons 19 brings a complete rebuild of everything that was in Seasons for Farming Simulator 17, and much more. It brings revamped visuals and audio and new tools. It also includes a new, more elaborate weather system with more events and full integration with the new sky of Farming Simulator 19. The improved growth system now provides a less predictable year and provides crop rotation to keep you planning year-over-year. The animals have been improved with grazing and breeds, and working with grass has gotten a do-over to align more with the real life process.
