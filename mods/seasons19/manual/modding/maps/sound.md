# Sound
{:.no_toc}

A map contains many objects, including houses, roads, trees but also traffic lights and other decorations. The vanilla game allows the use of 'admirers' to give certain behaviour to objects.
A good example is the `Nightlight2`: it makes the object visible during night and invisible during the day. Another example is the `SunAdmirer`, that makes an object only visible when the sun is. (It is invisible in bad weather or the night.)

Seasons adds some more of these 'admirers' to the game, to allow for seasonal objects, such as a BBQ in the summer or a hearth in the winter.
