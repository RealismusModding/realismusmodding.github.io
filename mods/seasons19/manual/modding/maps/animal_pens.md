# Animal pens

The new placeable animal pens have some special properties that are used by Seaosons to support grazing.

Every animal pen that has grass inside needs to define grass foliage areas in its placeable. Even placeables that are placed by the map maker directly (and thus do not place grass themselves).

These foliage areas for grass are used to determine the amount of grass in the pen available for grazing and where this grass is.
