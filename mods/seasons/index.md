{% lead %}Seasons is about more than just adding pretty textures corresponding to a season and snow. It is an attempt to better simulate a year in a farmer’s life. Nearly every aspect of Farming Simulator has been carefully rethought and rewritten from growth to weather, crop prices, loans and the vehicle maintenance system. It is a mod designed for the players who do not like being able to sow, harvest and sow again all in one day.{% endlead %}
