# Economy for GEO mods
{:.no_toc}

The economy file used by Seasons defines changes in prices and costs over a year to simulate the global economy. For example, for most crops that are harvested in the autumn, the prices drop because of a high supply and lower demand.

Factors, fills, animals, bales

## Notes

Be careful when changing the values. Changing economy factors changes the whole economy, and thus the gameplay. You might be adding cheats to your game, which would be a pity. For example: if you increase the price of silage bales too much, you might not need to do anything other than making silage because it is way more profitable than anything else.
