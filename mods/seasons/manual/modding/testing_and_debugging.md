## Console commands

When working on mods, make sure to enable the in-game developer console. It will allow your to see errors directly when they are created. It will also give you access to console commands.

To enable to console, open the game.xml in your Farming Simulator folder, and change game.development.controls to `true`.

To use the console, open the game and press ~ on Windows (the key left of the 1), or ยง on Mac. Press it again to start input for commands. Press it once more to close the console.

### Commands supplied by the game

This is a small list of useful commands.

 - TODO

If you have cheats enabled by adding `-cheats` to your startup command, you will have access to these too:

 - gsFillVehicle to fill a tipper with a material
 - gsSetFieldFruit to set the fruit of a field

To find any command, type `gs` and then tab through them.
