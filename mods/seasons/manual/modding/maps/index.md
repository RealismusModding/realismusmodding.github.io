# Maps

In this section you will find all information you need to make great maps with Seasons in mind.

The first thing to do is adding the seasons mask to the map. A full guide is available. On top of that you can add seasonal objects and admirers, of which also a guide is available. Third, you can add custom seasonal textures.

Lastly, you can add custom configurations of Seasons to your map, exactly like a GEO mod can. For this information, look into the GEO mod section. Make sure you put all the XML files in the root of your mod directory.

If you have any questions you can contact the team on [Slack](https://slack.realismusmodding.com).
