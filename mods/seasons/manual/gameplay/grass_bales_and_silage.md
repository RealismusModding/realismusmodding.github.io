# Grass bales and Silage

To  create hay  the grass must be dry enough to be able to use a tedder. If you see the “Wet Crops” icon in the top right corner, then you will not be able to create hay. Using a tedder when crops are wet or when it is raining, leaves wet grass, not dry grass. You will need to wait until the “Wet Crops” icon disappears and then use the tedder.

Swaths of straw and grass will start to rot and disappear if not baled in time and left on the ground. Currently they do not turn to manure, but simply reduce in size to simulate rotting.

Grass bales will gradually rot and disappear after two days, unless they are wrapped so that they become silage bales. Wrapped bales do not turn into silage immediately, but instead need some time to ferment. It takes one third of a season (1 transition) to fully ferment either a silage bale.

Hay and straw bales exposed to rain will start to rot so keep them inside sheds. These bales will only rot if the map has been prepared with a so called Seasons mask.

Chaff in bunkers will take one third of a season to ferment (same time as bales).
