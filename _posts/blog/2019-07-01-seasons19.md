What's new in Seasons 19?



<!-- more -->

## Growth

### Improved weeds

PATCHES
preemptive spraying is possible with a sprayer

Note that workers will stop once the weed ends. So the bits of weed you will need to handle by hand. The helpers are not intelligent enough.

### Weather-influenced growth

PCF




There are 3 new growth states: planted, germinated and germination failed. Soil temperature impacts germination and if you plant when the soil temperatures are favourable, then the crops will go to the germinated state. It is possible for crops planted too late to germinate, but they will never mature. Check the Seasons calendar and make sure to plant crops at the correct times. Germination now happens on a daily basis instead of only at period change. Normal growth still only occurs during a period change

Weeds now grow in patches only when the temperature is right. When it gets too cold they will start to die on their own. We have implemented preemptive spraying. If you spray early on you will not get weeds on the field until you harvest. Mechanical weeders can only remove young weeds and have no premptive function




### Crop Rotation

Crop rotation
Influence on yield year over year
Doing very well, yield > 1
Doing excellent, also get some extra fertilization

### More world information

Growth states: planted, gemination failed, germinated







## Weather

- Rain at night now looks better with new sky

### Detailed forecast and uncertainty


### Snow and the mask








## Animals

### Breeds

### Grazing

Grass inside animal pens automatically moves to the feeding throughs

### Water pump

The animals require a lot of attention. Daily feeding, daily watering. The water requirements of the animals have been corrected to be more realistic. To make it easier for players to have water in the troughs, a new water pump can be placed near the animal pen: it will automatically keep the water level of the water troughs at a minimum of 15%. The water cost is subtracted from your account.




## Better grass handling

Hay and straw heaps no longer rot inside due to engine changes
Rotting is based on weather.
Multi-step drying possible due to engine changesâ€™





## Improved visuals and audio

### Trees

Shader based tree coloring

### Lighting

New lighting setup for the new sky and atmosphere

### Sky

New weather system with cloud and sky integration.

#### Lightning

The sky now has lightning support: in bad weather the sky and the world can light up for lightning. Storms produce thunder sounds as well, and heavier storms will have lightning.

### Immersive ambient sound system

Seasons replaces the wind and rain sounds of the basegame with a new system. This new system ties in tightly with the visuals: it is now possible to hear how fast the wind is blowing or how heavy it rains or hails.





## Adjusted vehicle maintenance and repair

- Wear is based on operating time
- Repair
- Repaint
- Costs

We have switched the Seasons17 repair system for the basegame 19 repair, but added new algorithms for sell price and repair prices. Also, we have separated the scratches (visible wear) from the vehicle repair. To improve the performance of your vehicle you can repair. To make the vehicle nice and shiny again you will need to repaint the vehicle.
