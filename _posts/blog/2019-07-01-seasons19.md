What's new in Seasons 19?



<!-- more -->

## Growth

### Improved weeds

PATCHES
preemptive spraying is possible with a sprayer

Note that workers will stop once the weed ends. So the bits of weed you will need to handle by hand. The helpers are not intelligent enough.

### Weather-influenced growth

PCF




There are 3 new growth states: planted, germinated and germination failed. Soil temperature impacts germination and if you plant when the soil temperatures are favourable, then the crops will go to the germinated state. It is possible for crops planted too late to germinate, but they will never mature. Check the Seasons calendar and make sure to plant crops at the correct times. Germination now happens on a daily basis instead of only at period change. Normal growth still only occurs during a period change

Weeds now grow in patches only when the temperature is right. When it gets too cold they will start to die on their own. We have implemented preemptive spraying. If you spray early on you will not get weeds on the field until you harvest. Mechanical weeders can only remove young weeds and have no premptive function




### Crop Rotation

Influence on yield year over year
Doing very well, yield > 1
Doing excellent, also get some extra fertilization

## Weather

- Rain at night now looks better with new sky

### Detailed forecast and uncertainty


### Snow and the mask








## Animals

### Breeds

### Grazing

The grazing mod from Farming Simulator 17 has been integrated directly into Seasons 19. Animals in pens that have grass will consume the grass as replacement for the grass in the trough. Be careful, as the grass in a pen can be completely eaten already. This depends on the size of the pen, on the amount of animals, and the time of year.

The changes of the animal pens into placeables that plant their own grass, together with more engine changes, allowed for automatic detection of the grass. No map changes are required. The only requirement is that the animal pen has grass.

### Water pump

The animals require a lot of attention. Daily feeding, daily watering, maybe even daily riding. The water requirements of the animals have been corrected to be more to realistic standards. To make it easier for players to have water in the troughs, a new water pump can be placed near the animal pen: it will automatically keep the water level of the water troughs at a minimum of 15%. The water cost is subtracted from your account.

## Better grass handling

The many engine and script changes in Farming Simulator 19 allowed for many new features. Two of those are a multi-step grass drying process, and improved rotting.

A new multi-step drying process has been added to create hay. When cutting wet grass, it needs to be tedded. Afterwards it needs to dry in the sun to become hay. When cutting dry (low moisture) grass, it does not need tedding but still needs to dry.
This means that making hay now depends on the weather. Good planning is required. The more detailed forecast will certainly help here.

If hay is left in the rain it will turn wet again, and afterwards it will start to rot. Freshly mown grass will rot after left outside for more than a day as well.

Hay and straw rots when kept outside in the rain. Even straw and hay heaps inside buildings will not rot anymore, like was the case in Seasons 17. Grass still always rots, as this material is wet. With the new drying system described above, it will take two days instead of one for the rotting to start on grass heaps.

## Improved visuals and audio

<!-- trees -->

Seasons 19 has received a new system for tree visuals: custom shaders. Together with GIANTS, the team has created new shaders and special custom textures. The trees now gradually change their looks, instead of the sudden color switch in Farming Simulator 17. The leafs grow in spring until fully grown in summer, after which they will brown for autumn.
The color of the tree depends on the time of year, the tree and on the weather.

<!-- Lighting -->

The lighting of Seasons has been rewritten to fully fit the new lighting system of Farming Simulator 19. It removes the moon in favor of darker nights and improves the dawn and dusk lighting. Of course the amount of daylight depends on the time of the year and the location of the GEO.

<!-- Sky -->

The new weather system fully integrates with the new cloud system. A varying amount of clouds are shown throughout the day and move with the wind direction. With these changes, the weather during the night is finally working well.

On top of the cloud system, Seasons adds a new weather event: storms. Storms produce thunder and an occasional lightning effect will light up your fields.

### Immersive ambient sound system

Seasons replaces the wind and rain sounds of the basegame with a new system. This new system ties in tightly with the visuals: it is now possible to hear how fast the wind is blowing or how heavy it rains or hails.
A large set of sounds is being mixed in real time to create the desired effects both inside a vehicle and outside a vehicle.





## Adjusted vehicle maintenance and repair

- Wear is based on operating time
- Repair
- Repaint
- Costs

We have switched the Seasons17 repair system for the basegame 19 repair, but added new algorithms for sell price and repair prices. Also, we have separated the scratches (visible wear) from the vehicle repair. To improve the performance of your vehicle you can repair. To make the vehicle nice and shiny again you will need to repaint the vehicle.
