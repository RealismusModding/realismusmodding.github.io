Last week we posted about Seasons support and ModHub. Today I want to elaborate on where the community seems to be going, and what role Giants and ModHub play into it.

Farming Simulator has always been a German game from a German company. It used to be called "Landwirtschafts-Simulator" and had an almost exclusively German community. This is changing.

Since Farming Simulator 15, and especially since Farming Simulator 17, both the game, the community and Giants software has grown. We now see major modders outside of Germany (see the ModContest 17 results), a more international and open crew at Giants, and a wider audience: from all of Europe, Russia, the U.S.A. and even Brazil.


This also has a big effect on how mods are made, and for what audience.


LANGUAGE/INTERNATIONALIZATION

For this it has become much more important to translate your mods contents and descriptions. ModHub already forces an english, french and german translation, which is a very good start, as most of the players know either of these languages. However, often players prefer their own language, either because they are young or have young kids and don't know one of these languages, or because they are not known with foreign farming terms such as 'Miststreuer' and 'Feldh√§cksler'.


We would like to encourage all modders to add at least these translations to their mods and descriptions. Accept translations from players and be open to them: show up on the forums or put a link in the mod for contacting you or your team. If you don't trust the translation, either throw it in Google Translate to find possible bad words, or don't use it.

We would also like to encourage every player of the game and mods to help with making these translations. The best translations are done by native speakers: only a German can make German translations, and only an Italian can make Italian translations. If you have a translations for a modder, find that person on [Discord](https://discord.gg/rWcF5fr), the [forums](https://forum.giants-software.com/) or their own website.

MODHUB

As I noted with the previous blogpost, ModHub is......
