_This post is part of a series with background information on Seasons. The previous post was about [ground wetness](/blog/2017/11/09/grount-wetness)._

Seasons 1.2 introduced a new device: the Wopstr M420, made by Wopstr Agro. It is a handtool to help the farmer het more information on soil, trees, bales and more. If you want to read more about how the Wopstr works, we have a [gameplay page on our manual](/mods/seasons/manual/gameplay/measuring). In this post I want to elaborate on how we made this, and why.

### Why we made the tool

For a long time, information about bales and fields could be given by the Game Extension mod. This mod however felt very artificial, with its constant overlays in the bottom right corner. This is not how a farmer would receive information. ....

We also figured that many things a real farmer could do, were not easy to do in the game, or not at all. .....
