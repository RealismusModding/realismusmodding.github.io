### Hauer Snow Pack

Together with GIANTS Software we have created two brand new licensed tools from Hauer: the SRS-3 snow blade and the TS-215 salt spreader. Use it together with Seasons 19 to manage the snow around your yard and fields.

The mod requires Seasons to work. Seasons provides BigBags of road salt in the shop.

It can be downloaded in the ModHub under 'Gameplay' or 'Misc', or on the [ModHub website](https://farming-simulator.com/mod.php?mod_id=). TODO LINK
